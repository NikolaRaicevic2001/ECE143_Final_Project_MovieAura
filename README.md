# Main.py
Gathers all the movie scores from four submodules and weights them according to the relevance of each submodule to derive a final score to be sorted. From the sorted list the first five movies are chosen as the user recommendations.

# Data_Processing.py
Contains a class that processes dataset returning different fields that could be relevant for submodules. The Movies_Merged.csv file is created that merges all the relevant fields from the 16000-movies-1910-2024-metacritic and tmdb-movies-dataset-2023-930k-movies datasets. The two datasets were merged according to the movie title match from both datasets.

# Submodule_01_Image_Based.py 
This submodule implements a Hybrid Content-Based Filtering System to recommend movies by integrating visual, genre, and textual attributes. It leverages multiple feature types and calculates similarity scores to identify movies similar to user input.  

### Key Features
1. Feature Combination
   Combines multiple attributes of a movie (e.g., visual embeddings, genres, descriptions) into a unified feature matrix for robust similarity calculations.
   - Visual Embeddings (ResNet-50): Captures visual features from movie posters.
   - Genres: Encoded as binary features.
   - Descriptions: Processed using TF-IDF vectorization.
This ensures recommendations consider both thematic and visual similarity.

2. Data Normalization
   Applies MinMaxScaler to scale visual, genre, and textual features to a uniform range. This ensures equal importance across different feature types.

3. Similarity Calculation
   - Computes cosine similarity scores based on the combined feature matrix:
   - Measures the similarity between movies using visual, textual, and genre features.
   - Supports aggregated similarity scores for multiple input movie titles.
4. Flexible Input
   Accepts one or more movie titles as input:
   - Matches input movies against the dataset.
   - Returns a probabilities of all movies in the dataset to be recommended. 

### How It Works
1. Feature Extraction: Extract visual embeddings, encode genres, and vectorize descriptions using TF-IDF.
2. Data Normalization: Normalize extracted features for uniformity.
3. Feature Combination: Combine visual, genre, and text features into a single feature matrix.
4. Similarity Computation: Calculate cosine similarity scores between the input movies and all movies in the dataset.
5. Recommendation Generation: Return aggregated similarity scores and a ranked list of recommendations for user-specified movies.

# Submodule_02_Content_Based.py
This submodule implements a **Content-Based Filtering** system to recommend movies based on weighted features. It enhances movie attributes and calculates similarity scores to identify similar movies.

### Key Features
1. **Feature Combination with Weights**  
   Combines multiple attributes of a movie (e.g., genres, keywords, description) into a weighted string for better similarity calculations. Default weights are:
   - **Genre**: 2  
   - **Keywords**: 3  
   - **Summary, Director, and others**: 1  

2. **TF-IDF Vectorization**  
   Processes combined features using TF-IDF vectorization to represent movies as feature vectors.

3. **Similarity Calculation**  
   Computes cosine similarity scores between movies based on their feature vectors. Supports aggregated similarity scores for multiple input movie titles.
   
4. **Flexible Input**  
   Accepts one or more movie titles and computes similarity scores against all movies in the dataset.

### How It Works
1. Combine weighted features for each movie using attributes like genres, keywords, description, tagline, director, etc.
2. Vectorize the combined features using TF-IDF.
3. Compute cosine similarity scores between input movies and the dataset.
4. Return aggregated similarity scores for user-specified movie titles.

# **Submodule_03_Graph_Based.py**
This submodule implements a **Graph-Based Filtering system** combining **BM25/TF-IDF similarity** with the **PageRank algorithm** to recommend movies, integrating both **textual** and **numeric features**.

### Key Features
1. Text Features: Uses textual attributes with weighted importance:  
- **Genres** (2), **Keywords** (3)  
- **Description, Tagline, Written by, Directed by, Language, Companies** (1 each)

2. Numeric Features: Uses normalized numeric attributes:  
- **Release Year** (0.1), **Runtime** (0.1)  

### How it works
1. Text Similarity:
- **TF-IDF Vectorization**: Uses TF-IDF to process combined movie features, similar to Submodule_02 and Submodule_01. 
- **BM25 Scoring**: Leverages BM25, a robust ranking function that emphasizes term relevance by accounting for term frequency and document length.

2. Numeric Similarity:
- **Normalization**: Scales numeric features using `StandardScaler`.  
- **Cosine Similarity**: Computes cosine similarity between normalized numeric features to quantify similarity.

3. Graph Construction & PageRank:
- **Graph Nodes**: Treats movies as **nodes** and assigns **edge weights** based on combined BM25/TF-IDF and numeric similarity scores. 
- **PageRank**: Computes **global importance scores** for each movie. Iteratively refines rankings based on graph connectivity, emphasizing both direct similarity and network-wide relationships. 

# Submodule_04_Transformer.py
This submodule implements **Transformer Encoder** system to recommend movies based on numerical features. The model used is SASRec/BERT4Rec based Transformer-based arhitecture designed specifically for recommendation tasks. The model uses self-attention mechanism to model user sequence and can handle both sequential dependancies (past movies) and incorporate information or context based embeddings. 

 - **Input Format**: The list of movies with their specific numerical embeddings including Adult movie, Genres, Production Country, Keywords, Description, Rating, Popularity, and Release Year. The Adult category was binary either true/false; Genres and Production Country was one-hot encoded; Rating, Popularity, and Release Year was normalized so that the features are in the range of 0 to 1; Keywords and Description features were extracted using pre-trained language model BERT to create a dense vector representation.

 - **Output Format**: The model generates sequence of logits which are scores for each movie to be corrolated with the input sequence of the movies. The softmax function is later used to generate a probability distribution over the potential next movies based on the sequence and contextual information.
