# ECE143_Final_Project
This project aims to develop a personalized movie recommender system that delivers tailored recommendations based on user viewing history, genre preferences, and similar user preferences. This recommender can enhance user satisfaction by simplifying the content discovery process and minimizing search time.

# Main.py
Gathers all the movie scores from four submodules and weights them according to the relevance of each submodule to derive a final score to be sorted. From the sorted list the first five movies are chosen as the user recommendations.
